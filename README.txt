## What was the purpose for selecting this project?
### Abstract
**Diabetic retinopathy** is a leading problem throughout the world and many people are losing their
vision because of this disease. The disease can get severe if it is not treated properly at its early
stages. The damage in the retinal blood vessel eventually blocks the light that passes through the
optical nerves which makes the patient with Diabetic Retinopathy blind. Therefore, in our
research we wanted to find out a way to overcome this problem and thus using the help of
**Convolutional Neural Network** (ConvNet), we wereable to detect multiple stages of severity for
Diabetic Retinopathy. There are other processes present to detect Diabetic Retinopathy and one
such process is manual screening, but this requires a skilled ophthalmologist and takes up a huge
amount of time. Thus our automatic diabetic retinopathy detection technique can be used to
**replace** such **manual processes** and theophthalmologist can spend more time taking proper care
of the patient or at least decrease the severity of this disease.

### Condition Of Diabetic Retinopathy In India

Currently, In India diabetes is a disease that affects over 65 million persons in India. 

Diabetes-related eye disease, of which retinopathy is the most important, affects nearly one out of every ten persons with diabetes, according to point prevalence estimates. Many few of them are aware of that if they have diabetes for over several years they may come across the diabetic complication.

To spread awareness among people major hospitals in India organizes the free eye checkup camps in villages where people can get their eye checkup for free. 

Those retinal images of people were collected and sent to an expert Ophthalmologist. After that, the Ophthalmologist examines those images and the summons those patients who were likely to suffer from Diabetic Retinopathy. 

This summoned patient than were informed that they are likely to suffer from Diabetic Retinopathy and should consult the expert Ophthalmologist for a proper checkup.

This whole process takes almost half a month or more and to shorten this gap we had come up with the idea which almost cut down these process into one or two days, which help the Ophthalmologist to focus more on the treatment and avoid the hectic work of identifying which patient has Diabetic Retinopathy and which doesn't.

## What was our approach?
### Why we have selected ConvNet to solve this problem? / Objective
Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in the working-age population of the developed world. The condition is estimated to affect over 93 million people.

The need for a comprehensive and automated method of diabetic retinopathy screening has long been recognized, and previous efforts have made good progress using image classification, pattern recognition, and machine learning. With photos of eyes as input, the goal of this project is to create a new model, ideally resulting in realistic clinical potential.

The motivations for this project are twofold:

1. Image classification has been a personal interest for years, in addition to classification on a large scale data set.

2. Time is lost between patients getting their eyes scanned (shown below), having their images analyzed by doctors, and scheduling a follow-up appointment. By processing images in real-time, EyeNet would allow people to seek & schedule treatment the same day
