### Abstract
**Diabetic retinopathy** is a leading problem throughout the world and many people are losing their
vision because of this disease. The disease can get severe if it is not treated properly at its early
stages. The damage in the retinal blood vessel eventually blocks the light that passes through the
optical nerves which makes the patient with Diabetic Retinopathy blind. Therefore, in our
research we wanted to find out a way to overcome this problem and thus using the help of
**Convolutional Neural Network** (ConvNet), we wereable to detect multiple stages of severity for
Diabetic Retinopathy. There are other processes present to detect Diabetic Retinopathy and one
such process is manual screening, but this requires a skilled ophthalmologist and takes up a huge
amount of time. Thus our automatic diabetic retinopathy detection technique can be used to
**replace** such **manual processes** and theophthalmologist can spend more time taking proper care
of the patient or at least decrease the severity of this disease.

### Objective
Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in the working-age population of the developed world. The condition is estimated to affect over 93 million people.

The need for a comprehensive and automated method of diabetic retinopathy screening has long been recognized, and previous efforts have made good progress using image classification, pattern recognition, and machine learning. With photos of eyes as input, the goal of this project is to create a new model, ideally resulting in realistic clinical potential.

### Motivations:

1. Image classification has been a personal interest for years, in addition to classification on a large scale data set.

2. Time is lost between patients getting their eyes scanned (shown below), having their images analyzed by doctors, and scheduling a follow-up appointment. By processing images in real-time, EyeNet would allow people to seek & schedule treatment the same day
